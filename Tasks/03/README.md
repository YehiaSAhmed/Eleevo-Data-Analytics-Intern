# Task 3 : Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

* This project applies *RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis* to the **Online Retail dataset** in order to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

* The main objective is to:
    1. Clean and preprocess the dataset.
    2. Calculate RFM scores for each customer.
    3. Segment customers into meaningful groups.
    4. Visualize the distribution of customers across segments.
    5. Suggest simple marketing idea for each segment.

* RFM analysis helps businesses identify their most valuable customers and design targeted marketing strategies (e.g., rewarding loyal customers, re-engaging inactive ones, or offering discounts to price-sensitive customers).

## üîó Data Source


The dataset is taken from the uc irvine machine learning repository üëâ [Online Retail - UCI Machine Learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).

## üõ† Data Preprocessing

Steps performed before analysis:

1. **Removed duplicates**
2. **Filtered invalid transactions** (Quantity > 0, UnitPrice > 0)
3. **Dropped missing values (NaN)**
4. **Created `TotalPrice` column** = `Quantity √ó UnitPrice`

## üìä RFM Analysis

* **Recency (R)**: Days since last purchase &rarr; more recent = better
* **Frequency (F)**: Number of invoices &rarr; more frequent = better
* **Monetary (M)**: Total spent by customer &rarr; higher = better

### Scoring:

* Each metric (R, F, M) was divided into **10 quantiles (1‚Äì10)**.
* **R\_Score** was reversed (lower days &rarr; higher score).
* **RFM\_Score** was generated as a combination of the three scores.
